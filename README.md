## GROUP 3 - FINAL PROJECT

# IS MUSIC TOO LOUD IN MANHATTAN?

### INTRODUCTION

For our final project we decided to follow an idea proposed by Prof. Saldarriaga during one of the first lectures in the course, which was "visualizing the sounds of the city." However, at the beginning of our research we encountered that the available data sets were scarce, which prompted us to look for a means to find indirect insigths into the soundscape of the city. This in turn, brought our attention to the data for noise complaints reported to _311_ across the years.

After careful consideration the team decided to narrow the focus of our analysis over music complaints in Manhattan, since the data set was too rich for the given time constraints and scope of our final assignment. We focused on music complaints because they comprise _47%_ of the total number of noise complaints in Manhattan, and greatly outnumber the second-most type of complaint, which is construction sounds, by an almost twofold margin. For the purpose of specificity, we decided to analize the loud music complaints throughout an area that would cover Manhattan from North to South, which is why we chose to follow the trail of complaints over the length of _Broadway Avenue_. 

Finally, we decided to compare noise complaints against demographic variables from NYC Open Data, hoping to find connections between our subject and other measurements, such as income, education, and population.

### DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
#### Oskar Garcia, og2236

I have to start by mentioning that our dataviz course is surprisingly diverse in the amount of material and skills covered, considering we only meet once a week for a single semester. As some of the guest reviewers mentioned during our final presentation, and I paraphrase, this course is a mix between data visualization, copywriting, graphic design, programming, web development, and interactive design.

As such, it made for a wide, and interesting field of choices when it came to our final project. Our teams, all of which were made up of a veritable mix of creative individuals, had to face the reality of completing a creative project in the span of four weeks, which for a well established, professional agency would take months to complete.

Faced with such a challenge we decided to distribute the work based on our individual strengths, such that my responsibilities were aligned more with the design and programming aspect of the project, while the rest of my peers tackled other tasks like data parsing, number wrangling, copywriting, and editing.

#### – THE SITE

As someone who has been programming for less than 7 months, I considered that the final project was the best way to gain practice over HTML5 and CSS3, which we touched upon briefly during the beginning of the course before we shifted into P5.js as our main technology. This meant having to learn about the CSS grid layout and its integration with JavaScrip (JS) and HTML, as opposed to relying on solutions like pre-made wordpress templates, or Bootstrap. Thus the final layout for our site, though humble because of the time constraints, was custom designed and custom coded for the course.

The fonts were paired from Google Fonts, and the color palette was kept simple for brevity. Our header was produced with an open sourced image from unsplash.com, and a bit of manipulation with Photoshop.

#### – THE VISUALIZATIONS

Though we focused mostly on using P5.js as a jumping off framework for learning JS, we had few opportunities for building a fully functional interactive chart from scratch, and our project needed something more robust to achieve the type of visualizations we wanted to implement.

Thus, after researching specialized JS frameworks and libraries, I decided to learn how to use an open source library called Charts.js. The library holds many features that allow for many degrees of creative freedom when producing interactive charts, but unfortunately, the learning curve is still very steep.

However, the library allowed for us to visually express the data in the way we had prototyped it, which meant stacking line graphs over a series of circles whose area represents the total quantity of complaints per neighborhood. Though not loaded with interactive bells and whistles, our graphs translated our sketches and protoypes into real, working designs with a clean aesthetic.
